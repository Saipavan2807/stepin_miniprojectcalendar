## SWOT Analysis
## Strengths 
 strengths included working with a monochromatic color palette, sans serif type, and traditional grid structures. My work tends to be typographically heavy structurally simple. This calendar was intended to be a wall calendar that would last for a number of years and conserve paper. Each white square is a pocket that holds a removable slip of paper. The orange denotes the details of the particular day.
 ## Weaknesses
Design weaknesses included working with a complex color palette, serif or decorative type, and non-traditional grid structures. Additionally, I wanted to make sure that my typographical treatments clearly supported the intention of the calendar.
## Threats
There are numerous dubious websites that contain deceptive advertisements, demand permission to show notifications, and display deceptive pop-up windows and other intrusive content that should not be clicked. Furthermore, many people have recently noticed that unwanted events are added to the Calendar application on their mobile Apple devices. Research shows that these events are usually added after clicking pop-up windows, notifications, etc.,
## Opportunities
Range selection - select dates in a range. The design is entirely up to you.
 Boundary dates - limit the calendar date range
 Week/month mode - show 1 row of weekdays. Or 2, 3 or 6
 Custom cells - make your day-cells look however you want, with any functionality you want.
